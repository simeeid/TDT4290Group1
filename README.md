# Norbit Sensor System
This is the repo for Group 1 in TDT4290 customer driven project 2023.

## Description of the system
The purpose of the system is to create an IoT device simulator, for Norbit to collect and analyze sensor data from a device. There are three main components of the system: flutter mobile app, react web app and AWS cloud platform. The flutter mobile app is responsible for collecting sensor data from the users phone and display it to the user. The AWS cloud platform is responsible for storing user information in a secure manner, keeping track of the different devices connected to each user and transmitting sensor data. The react web app is responsible for displaying the sensor data for Norbit in a clear and useful way, through graphs.

### Mobile app
The mobile app is located in the norbit-mobileapp/flutter_application1 folder.

### Web app
