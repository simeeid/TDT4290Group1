# Web app

The web app is created using Next.js with React.

The purpose of the web app is to display the sensor data from the mobile app in a useful manner. The web app displays different sensor data in graphs, in addiotion to location data in a map. Meta data, such as latency, is displayed for the corresponding sensor. Before using the web app you need to connect to a mobile device, this can be done in the sidemenu. After connecting to your device, you can select which sensor data you want to be displayed on screen. This functionality is also available in the sidemenu.
